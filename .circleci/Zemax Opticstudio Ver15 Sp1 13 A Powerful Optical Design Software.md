Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 is compatible with Windows 10, 8.1, and 7 (64-bit only). It requires a minimum of 8 GB RAM, 2 GB disk space, and a graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher. It also supports parallel processing with multiple CPU cores and GPUs.
 
If you are interested in learning more about Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13, you can visit the official website[^5^] or request a free trial[^6^]. You can also watch some webinars[^5^], read some case studies[^6^], or check out some tutorials[^5^] to see how Zemax Opticstudio can help you design better optical systems.
  
One of the key features of Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 is its ability to model both imaging and illumination systems in a single environment. Imaging systems are those that form an image of an object, such as a camera or a telescope. Illumination systems are those that distribute light over a target area, such as a projector or a headlamp. Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 can handle both types of systems with equal ease and accuracy, using different modes and tools for each application.
 
Another feature of Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 is its support for phosphor and fluorescence modeling. Phosphors are materials that emit light when excited by another light source, such as LEDs or lasers. Fluorescence is a similar phenomenon, but it occurs in organic molecules or biological samples. Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 can simulate the spectral and spatial distribution of phosphor and fluorescence emission, as well as their effects on color, brightness, and efficiency of optical systems. This feature is especially useful for designing displays, medical devices, and biophotonics applications.
 
A third feature of Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 is its capability for stray light analysis. Stray light is any unwanted light that reaches the detector or the eye, causing glare, ghost images, or reduced contrast. Stray light can originate from various sources, such as reflections, scattering, diffraction, or leakage. Zemax Opticstudio Ver15 Sp1 13 can identify and quantify the sources and paths of stray light in optical systems, using ray tracing and non-sequential mode. It can also provide solutions to minimize or eliminate stray light, such as baffles, stops, coatings, or filters.
